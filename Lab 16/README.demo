# Disable insecure port to the API server

The insecure port in an API server is disabled on default. But to see it in action
we can enable it. The danger is that, a request to the API will skip authentication and authorization.

# Create cluster 
kind create cluster --config cluster.yaml

# Run an insecure proxy
kubectl proxy --port=8080 &

# Test the API
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Delete cluster
kind delete cluster
